2. Choosing a license is important because it tells other people what they can and cannot do with your program. It can let people contribute to your code.

3. You shouldn't use a project that has no explicit license because those are considered "All Rights Reserved". That is the highest level of intellectual property protection.

4. I agree. Gopher was coming off as shady to programmers because they were charging for .com domains, but not .edu. By not being open source, they had to make decisions themselves and didn't let their users make changes and better their system.

5. Linux uses GPL v2, which requires that anyone who distributes software based on source code under this license, must make the originating source code available to the recipient under the same terms. Linux probably chose this license because they want their code to be available to everyone. Also, there's no warranty under this license, so they wouldn't be liable if a user experiences problems.

6. MIT License
